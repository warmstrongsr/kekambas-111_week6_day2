# kekambas-111_week6_phonebook
Flask weekend project.  Phone/Address book

Finalize the phonebook application that you have been working on this week. The phonebook should have the following capabilities:

- Users can sign up to use your application

- A user can create new addresses that are associated with them (One to Many relationship between User and Address)

- A user should only be able to create an address if they are logged in

- A user should be able to view all of the addresses that they have added

- A user should be able to edit an address that they created

- A user should be able to delete an address that they created

- Logged out users attempting to create, edit, or delete an address should be redirected to the login page

- The UI/UX should be easy and intuitive. A simple navbar with working links, message flashing, etc.
